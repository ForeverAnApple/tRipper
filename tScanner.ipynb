The purpose of this tool is to obtain public keys from SSL certificates (SSH, PGP may come later). The other point of this tool is to format the RSA keys correctly to extract the modulus of each key to insert into Tetanus for further analysis."

The code will reflect on that and continue to test new generated IPs until it reaches the VALID_CERTS limit."
